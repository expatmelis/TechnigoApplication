  <h2 style="color:green;">What is it?</h2>
  <p><strong>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)</strong> is not a programming language. HTML is a markup language devised to create websites. The language tells browsers how to structure the web pages that can be viewed by anyone else connected to the internet. Every web page on the Internet is written using one version of HTML code or another.</p>
  <h2 style="color:green;">What does it consist of?</h2>
  <p>HTML consists of a series of elements, which can be used to enclose, wrap, or mark up different parts of content to make it appear or act a certain way when openned in a browser. The enclosing tags can create a hyperlink to another page on the web, italicize words, and so on. HTML is constantly evolving to meet the requirements of internet users. The organisation responsible for designing and maintaining the language is the W3C.</p>
  <h2 style="color:green;">What can HTML be used for?</h2>
  <p>HTML is used to give a basic structure to a page while Cascading Style Shets, or CSS are overlayed to give a certain appearance to the page. The most recent iteration of HTML, <i>HTML5</i>, enables among other things:
  <p>- Web page development<br>- Navigation on the internet with hypertext<br>- Web document creation<br>- Responsive images on web pages<br>- Data entry support<br>- Usage of native APIs<p>
  <p>... so basically anything that we interact with on the internet - most of us on a daily basis.
